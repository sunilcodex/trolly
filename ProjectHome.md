# Trolly #

Trolly is a shopping list application for android with the aim of being a very simple app with no annoying or complicated features. Trolly exposes intent filters to allow other apps to automatically add items to the shopping list. Check out the [Bites](http://code.google.com/p/bites-android) cook book application for an example of an application that can auto add to Trolly.

For a brief lesson on driving a Trolly check out the UserManual.
