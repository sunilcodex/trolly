# User Manual #

Trolly is a simple application so this is really just a few simple pointers to make using Trolly faster and more efficient.

## Item States ##
All items on the shopping list are in one of three states:
  1. _Off List_ items were bought previously but not added to list this time. These are a faded out gray colour.
  1. _On List_ items currently on the shopping list. Tap an _Off List_ item to make it _On List_. These items are a bright green colour.
  1. _In Trolly_ items that were _On List_ but have been ticked off while shopping. Tap an _On List_ item to make it _In Trolly_, tap it again to move it back to _On List_. _In Trolly_ items are a grey colour with strikeout.

## Adding Items ##
Typing on a phone is slow so Trolly tries to avoid it as much as possible.

  * **New items** that have not been bought before have to be added by typing, there is now way around this yet. Add new items by by tapping the _Insert_ option on the options menu and entering the item in the dialog box. New items are automatically set to _On List_ status.

  * **Existing items**. After you have bought an item it is simply changed to _Off List_ status, not deleted from the list. If you need to add an item to your list that you have bought before, simply find it on the list and tap it to change its status to _On List_.

  * **Filter** If your list of items gets too big to scroll through quickly, Trolly also has a filter. Just type in a few letters of your item in _List Mode_ and only the items whose names match will be shown. This filter will reduce your list to two or three items very quickly.

## Checkout ##
When you finished shopping, just tap the _Checkout_ option on the options menu. This will move all _In Trolley_ items to _Off List_ i.e. they have been bought and are no longer on your shopping list.

## Modes ##
Trolly has two modes of operation _Listing_ and _Shopping_ which you change between by clicking the buttons of the same names at the top of the screen.

  1. Listing
In _Listing_ mode you are creating a shopping list. The icon in the centre top of the screen will be a list with a blue background. In _Listing_ mode items in all states will be displayed allowing a one click addition to you shopping list (change _Off List_ to _On List_).

  1. Shopping
In _Shopping_ mode you are at the shops and picking up items on your list. The icon in the top centre of the screen will be a trolly with an orange background. In _Shopping_ mode the list is filtered to exclude _Off List_ items, so you only see items you need to buy _(On List)_ and items you have ticked off _(In Trolly)_.

Enjoy using Trolly, and please let me know if anything here is unclear or different to how Trolly works for you.
